# APIM AI Gateway + Microsoft Foundry — Live Demo Runbook

This runbook drives the in-person demo of **Azure API Management as an AI Gateway
in front of Microsoft Foundry**. Follow the numbered files in order. Each file
lists, for one demo segment:

- **Portal click-path** — what to open and click while screen-sharing.
- **CLI / script** — the exact command to run (tests live in `clients/`).
- **What the audience should see** — the expected output / "money shot".
- **Screenshot** — a placeholder path under `docs/assets/` for a captured image.

## Conventions

- All gateway values (URL, keys, deployment names, project endpoint) are written
  to [clients/.env](../../clients/.env) automatically by `terraform output` during
  provisioning. The test scripts and `run_all.py` read that file.
- **Python interpreter:** the test scripts require the project venv at
  `.inspect-venv/bin/python` (the system `python3` cannot import the Azure SDK).
  Every command below uses it explicitly.
- Every request is stamped with `x-test-run-id` and `x-user-id`, so the exact
  traffic for a run is filterable in the Azure Monitor workbook within seconds.
