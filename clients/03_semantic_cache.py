"""03 - Semantic caching (llm-semantic-cache-lookup / -store).

Capability: the gateway stores LLM responses in a vector cache (Azure Managed
Redis) keyed by prompt *embeddings*. Semantically-similar later prompts return
the cached answer - no model call - cutting cost and latency.

Asserts (deterministic):
  * three semantically-equivalent prompts all return the SAME response id.

Why response id, not latency: a cache *lookup* still computes the query
embedding (a network round-trip to the embeddings backend), so a hit does not
collapse to "tens of ms" - latency alone is a flaky signal. A cache HIT instead
replays the *stored* response verbatim, including its OpenAI `chatcmpl-...` id.
A real model call always mints a fresh id. So if paraphrased prompts share one
id, the gateway served them from the vector cache. If the cache were broken,
every call would hit the model and every id would differ.

Latency for each call is printed for the demo narrative.
