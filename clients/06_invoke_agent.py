"""06 - Invoke the hosted Foundry agent (Azure assistant + Microsoft Learn MCP).

Capability: the pre-created prompt agent `agent-aigw-demo` runs server-side in
Foundry Agent Service. It is an Azure assistant whose tool is the Microsoft
Learn MCP server, fronted by the gateway (MCP passthrough). We invoke it via the
project's OpenAI Responses client and confirm it completes a turn, optionally
calling its MCP tool to ground the answer in Microsoft Learn docs.

Asserts:
  * the agent returns a non-empty answer (HTTP success through the Responses API)
  * (best-effort) the response shows a tool call OR references Azure/Learn docs,
    proving the MCP tool path works

This requires Azure auth (DefaultAzureCredential / `az login`) and reaches the
Foundry project endpoint directly. The chat tests above prove the *gateway*
path; this proves agents work end-to-end and are governable.
